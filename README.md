# MPI_Jacobi
A jacobi solver in C++ to perform weak scaling tests.

It is based on the example from the Book (Chapter 9, Section 9.3.2)
"Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers" - 1st Edition, by Georg Hager, Gerhard Wellein

The primary objective of the C++ code is to perform scaling tests and not to implement a general Jacobi solver for different types of BC's etc. Therefore from the point of view of Jacobi solver the code is very basic.
